Subject: [PATCH 53/54] net: stmmac: Fix system freeze when bridge is enabled
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

On i.MX8M Plus platform an issue with bridge mode is observed, causing
the whole system to freeze because register access is performed while
clocks are disabled. As a workaround, lets keep clocks enabled on this
platform.

This bug was observed with two NXP i.MX8M Plus devices:

- Phytec phyboard-POLLUX
- Advantech EPC-R3720

The BUG can be reproducible by creating a simple bridge and assign the EQOS
interface to it. During the configuration, system will freeze with no error
message. The interface works flawlessly without bridge configuration.
